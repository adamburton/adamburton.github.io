short-description: Support work for Chagos Refugees Group (UK branch)

I have been doing small things to support the campaign for resettlement of the Chagos Islands since 2011. Briefly ... in the 1960s there was about 2,000 people living on the Chagos Archipelago in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The Chagossian population was forcibly removed from their islands by the British government to make way for a US military base. They were taken to Mauritius and the Seychelles and left in poverty. Chagossians have been fighting for their right of return to their homeland ever since. You can watch a film about their experience here http://johnpilger.com/videos/stealing-a-nation and read more about the .io domain herehttps://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal/, and here http://www.thedarksideof.io/. I have written to github about this.

I showed John Pilger's documentary Stealing A Nation and an article by Marie Rita ElysÃ©e Bancoult called A Simple Message for Britain: You Should Be Ashamed as part of an exhibition at Fishmarket Gallery in Northampton in 2011.

- In 2012, I made a little leaflet about Chagos that I handed out in Stoke Newington as part of an exhibition at Project Number.

- I organised some screenings of Stealing A Nation in Hackney during 2013.
The intention of the screenings was to bring a few people together, learn about something, and then talk about it in the hope that after lots of screenings there might be enough general awareness of the situation for some kind of group to form that would develop the project, organise more screenings, discussions, events.

As John Pilger explains in his conclusion to the film:

"The film you've just seen is not only the story of a single injustice, it's a rare glimpse of great power at its most ruthless. What was done to the people of the Chagos raises wider questions for those of us who live in powerful states like Britain and America. Why do we continue to allow our governments to treat people in small countries as either useful or expendable? Why do we accept specious reasons for the unnaceptable?"

Alongside my concern for Chagossians and my support their campaign, I think that their experience is an instructive example of how the state predominantly serves to maintain the power of elites whilst subordinating everyone else. The diplomatic historian uses the term Unpeople to describe the attitude of elites towards the victims of their system.  
I wanted the cause to provide a common understanding with which we might then be able to build upon and work together towards undermining this harmful system.

- As part of my work on the screenings I contacted Sabrina Jean, UK Chair of the Chagos Refugees Group. We have since become friends and I occasionally support her to make funding applications and other things like that.

Working with Sabrina and supporting the Chagossian community in Crawley, south of London, took priority over the screenings. The screenings were quite a lot of work that involved dealing with a near total lack of interest from people I contacted about it. It is really dispiriting to not get a response after sending out loads of emails to venues. To be fair, I think it was more to do with the lack of subsidised event spaces than people's desire to host political events. But it made what should have been the easy bit quite difficult.

The screenings that happened were excellent. I was not organised enough really, but I had good discussions with the people who came and though it did not develop into anything concrete I think everyone was energised from talking with other people about their concerns.

Another important part of the screenings was marketing them. I handed out hundreds of flyers near the venues a week or so before each screening. The flyer briefly explained the experience of the Chagossian people and about the film. I had quite a few quick chats with people about it and, as the film is available on-line I am sure that some of those people who took a flyer went home and watched it.

It was, shamefully, nowhere near enough.
