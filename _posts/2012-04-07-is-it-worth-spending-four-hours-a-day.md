title: Is it worth spending four hours a day reading the news Something Else?

I have been thinking, for almost as long as I have been doing, that the process that I go through to keep the *Something Else* blog updated, is arduous and wasteful of my time.

To explain briefly, I subscribe to a couple of hundred news feeds that I hope might feed me news about British foreign policy. Each day (not always) I read the hundreds of headlines that are fed in and select the ones that, based on some assessment of the article presented by its headline, might have something to do with British foreign policy. Then, if I have time, I read through some of those articles that I have selected, skimming the ones that are less interesting and reading in full the others. I take relevant clippings from these articles and post the clippings on the blog, with a link to the original article and tags that categorise the blog post in some way. I then tweet the headline of the article with a link to the blog, or the original article. Sometimes it is enjoyable, but in general I am worrying that I have not spent enough time on it - the back-log of articles that I have to read is beyond a thousand.

The point is that, through this process of research I am expanding my perception of what constitutes actions of the British government in terms of foreign policy, and developing my understanding of those actions and the context for them. With that understanding and using the clippings from the articles I hope to be able to put together (not necessarily write) new articles that answer my own questions about the British government's actions. I also see the blog as a resource for anyone interested in British foreign policy, as it is, hopefully, well indexed by the tags and so provides a, sort of, database of clippings, far from comprehensive, concerning British foreign policy issues. The twitter feed is, potentially, a useful aggregator for whoever might be interested.

The problem is that all of this takes up quite a lot of my time and when I began thinking about making a newspaper about British foreign policy several years ago I did not envision myself sat at a computer reading the news for six hours a day (which is what I need to do, not what I do). I want to do some of that, but, and whilst I am quite happy for the progress made by the work that I do to move slowly, I want something more to come from the work that has an ever so slightly more immediate impact, not immediate, but, tangible, or something, I am not sure.

Recently, thoughts about the aims of the project that I wrote down some time last year have been passing through my mind as I scan the headlines. I wrote:

The newspaper will:  

 - answer simple questions about world events in relation to Britain's involvement
 - listen to the victims of UK foreign policy
 - support the work of non-corporate media and independent journalists
 - emphasise historical context

This process, that I have described above, does do these things in a marginal way but certainly not to the degree that I had imagined when I wrote them down. Listening to the victims of UK foreign policy, for one, barely registers, because the sources for articles that I am using, for whatever reason, has not developed in that direction, apart from the few articles that are relevant from Pambazuka News and things from allAfrica. I also end up relying on the Guardian far more than I would like. The Guardian has good reporters who do good work and good investigative journalism but the articles (and journalists) are often marred (Marred?) by their processing through the establishment media and therefore can only, with few exceptions, represent elite interests. Independent media, whilst, of course, potentially suffering from the same effects through aspiration, et cetera, still, I should hope, avoid these problems by way of their nature, as independent, non-corporate, or whatever. I should probably read this through before I post it.

There is in fact little reason to post this at all. It is, really, an excuse for me to type out the thoughts that I have been having this morning about the newspaper and how it ought to work. I HATE the idea of posting this but I have a feeling that this is what 'bloggingâ€™ is and if I continue to write and then delete the things that I have some peculiar urge to tell people on the internet about I will not have much reason to keep a blog anymore.

I think that I need to change direction. Or, at least, see what happens if I start my research from a different place than I have been doing up to this point, because, apart from the fact that I cannot motivate myself to get up early enough in the morning to 'check the feeds', something is preventing me from focusing my energies on what I have been doing so far. That is some sort of conclusion.
