title: Some notes from Haitian Inspiration by Peter Hallward towards ‘tpiraiiwatwf’
---

I read: [http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/haitian-inspiration](http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/haitian-inspiration)

I made notes.

I put them *on here*:

These notes are notes towards an article about Haiti that I am making.

*Haitian Inspiration* was published in January 2004, one month before Jean-Bertrand Aristide (democratically elected President of Haiti) was forced by the United States onto a plane and into exile for seven years. The article establishes a line of reasoning that explains much of Haiti's past and which runs right through Damming the Flood (Peter Hallward's 2008 book on Haiti). The people of Haiti have a peculiar attitude about who ought to govern their existence and have held this attitude for as long as they have been the people of Haiti. It is this attitude problem, as described by Noam Chomsky, that first encouraged my  interest in Haitian history.
Noam is often asked: "What can we do?" and he sometimes responds by pointing to Haiti and suggesting that we do what Haitians are doing: get together and "[https://chomsky.info/warfare03/](take over the political system)."(1)
Peter Hallward explains:

> One factor above all, however, accounts for the outcome of what became one of the first modern instances of total war: the people's determination to resist a return to slavery under any circumstances. This is the great constant of the entire revolutionary sequence, and it is this that lends an overall direction to the otherwise convoluted series of its leaders' tactical manoeuvrings. As Carolyn Fick has established, when Dessalines, Christophe and the other black generals finally broke with the French in 1802, it was the constancy of their troops that enabled their eventual decision. 'The masses had resisted the French from the very beginning, in spite of, and not because of, their leadership. They had shouldered the whole burden and paid the price of resistance all along, and it was they who had now made possible the political and military reintegration of the leaders in the collective struggle.'(2)

Peter goes on to make a comparison between the leaders of that revolutionary 'popular political mobilization' and the leaders of the current one, making clear, it seems to me, the true nature of the power behind Jean-Bertrande Aristide. I suppose that it seems so to me because I have read Damming the Flood. The situation is severely distorted by less popular forces.

For my article I need to find a limit on how much historical context to provide. The importance of the colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti’s colonial name) to the French economy is explained succinctly:

    Recognized as a French territory from the late seventeenth century, by the 1780s Saint-Domingue had become far and away the most profitable colony in the world, the jewel in the French imperial crown and the basis for much of the new prosperity of its growing commercial bourgeoisie. 'On the eve of the American Revolution’, Paul Farmer notes, 'Saint-Domingue – roughly the size of the modern state of Maryland – generated more revenue than all thirteen North American colonies combined’; on the eve of the French Revolution it had become the worldʼs single largest producer of coffee and the source for around 75 per cent of its sugar.(3) This exceptional productivity was the result of an exceptionally cruel plantation economy, one built on the labour of slaves who were worked to death so quickly that even rapid expansion of the slave trade over these same years was unable to keep up with demand. Mortality levels were such that during the 1780s the colony absorbed around 40,000 new slaves a year. By 1789, Eric Williams suggests, this 'pearl of the Caribbean’ had become, for the vast majority of its inhabitants, 'the worst hell on earth’.(4)

The majority of the article is commentary on the importance of the Haitian revolution in the context of the French and American revolutions and explains the relevance of these issues to readers of Radical Philosophy. This historical context, beyond what I have noted above, is perhaps superfluous to my re-presentation of Peter’s work.

The conclusion seems to foretell the events of a month beyond its publication and the final sentence neatly summarises my intentions for the project:

    Aristideʼs greatest crime in the eyes of the 'international community’ was surely to have continued this struggle. Thermidorians of every age have tried to present an orderly, pacified picture of historical change as the consolidation of property, prosperity and security. Haitiʼs revolution testifies to the power of another conception of history and the possibility of a different political future.
