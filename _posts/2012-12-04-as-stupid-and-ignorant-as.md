In May and June of this year I read some books, pamphlets, articles, and essays about education. In the process I came across, made a note of, and typed up several passages from these writings that seem to, for whatever reason, resonate with me to the extent that I felt an urge to make a note of them, type them up and post them here. Some of these quotations went into a project that I was doing named Latymer Projects education project.

I worked with Emily Ballard, Natalie Marr, and Alistair Ashe of Latymer Projects in West London, to organise a series of discussion groups on community education. A lot of the reading, though done with the intention of finding useful texts to be read and talked about during the discussions, helped me in the thinking about what the discussions are for, why I organised them, why they are necessary.

I had intended to finish writing and post something about all of this, this, before or during the discussions but I was tired of reading and became distracted. The meetings were poorly attended because my efforts to attract an audience from within the housing estate that Latymer Projects is part of were ill-conceived. This experience and whatever I have learned from it seemed relevant to whatever I was going to write here in this.

What follows, then, are some mumbling thoughts that surround some quotes from the reading that I had intended to read and discuss as a group at the meetings. As far as I can tell, from reading it through several times, I do not seem to have made a point.

> Learning to read and write ought to be an opportunity for men [and women] to know what **speaking the word** really means: a human act implying reflection and action. As such it is a primordial human right and not the privilege of a few. Speaking the word is not a true act if it is not at the same time associated with the right of self-expression and world-expression, of creating and re-creating, of deciding and choosing and ultimately participating in society’s historical process.  
- Cultural Action for Freedom by Paulo Freire, 1970.

The discussion should engender discussion.  
My desire to discuss things comes out of wanting to read things but feeling as though sitting, reading, on my own in the lounge is selfish - not entirely, but a little. It seems likely that other people might like to read whatever I am reading also. If I arrange some space to talk about what we have read it might encourage us to get on with it. It might help us to understand better whatever the writing is about - in terms of, er, a lot of things - the relevance of it to our lives. This is part of the democratic process.

> The level of education in any society can be gauged by the degree of effective access each of the members has to the facts and tools that - within this society - affect his [or her] life. […] If access to facts and use of tools constitute the two most obvious freedoms needed to provide educational opportunity, the ability to convoke peers to a meeting constitutes the one through which the learning by an individual is translated into political process - and political process, in turn, becomes conscious personal growth.  
- After Deschooling, What?  by Ivan Illich (1973).

I suppose that to 'convoke peers to a meeting' might be the default response of anyone attempting to change something in the world, or the world. Discussion constitutes the democratic process whilst developing the individual. The formation of collectively organised institutions that are produced by and produce personal growth.  
Noam Chomsky expressed some thoughts about the development of anarchism in this interview:

> Peter Jay: How far does the success of libertarian socialism or anarchism really depend on a fundamental change in the nature of man, both in his motivation, his altruism, and also in his knowledge and sophistication?  

> Noam Chomsky: I think it not only depends on it but in fact the whole purpose of libertarian socialism is that it will contribute to it. It will contribute to a spiritual transformation - precisely that kind of great transformation in the way humans conceive of themselves and their ability to act, to decide, to create, to produce, to enquire - precisely that spiritual transformation that social thinkers from the left-Marxist traditions, from Luxembourg, say, through anarcho-syndicalists, have always emphasized. So, on the one hand, it requires that spiritual transformation. On the other hand, its purpose is to create institutions which will contribute to that transformation in the nature of work, the nature of creative activity, simply in social bonds among people, and through this interaction of creating institutions which permit new aspects of human nature to flourish. And then the building of still more libertarian institutions to which these liberated human beings can contribute. This is the evolution of socialism as I understand it.  
- The Relevance of Anarcho-syndicalism - interview with Peter Jay, 1976.

Whatever the positive attributes to be found in the products of today’s education system might be I doubt that there is any intention, from within those who administer and control the system, to transform human nature in the direction that is described above - elements of which are certainly not exclusively anarchist or socialist. There is an attempt to influence the collective human spirit but, as many of the writers I have been reading make clear, it has little or nothing to do with emancipation.

> Any system of formal education has serious limitations. It fails to reach the working population; offers no chance for late or multiple entry; ignores the educative influences of home, society, and workplace; tends to produce or perpetuate an elite; encourages conformity rather than healthy dissent; and requires ever increasing expenditure.  
- J. P. Naik, 1974. Quoted in Deschooling Revisited by Ian Lister (1976),  
 &nbsp; the introduction to After Deschooling, What? by Ivan Illich (1973).

The opening up of the education system is sought throughout everything that I have read. 'Perpetuate’ stands out for me from amongst these words. It makes me think about preservation of the status quo, and conservatism - tradition. In my mind education suggests progression and development. John Dewey broadly describes traditional education as follows:

> The subject-matter of education consists of bodies of information and of skills that have been worked out in the past; therefore, the chief business of the school is to transmit them to the new generation. In the past, there have also been developed standards and rules of conduct; moral training consists in forming habits of action in conformity with these rules and standards. Finally, the general pattern of school organization (by which I mean the relations of pupils to one another and to teachers) constitutes the school a kind of institution sharply marked off from other social institutions. Call up in imagination the ordinary schoolroom, its time-schedules, schemes of classification, of examination and promotion, of rules of order, and I think you will grasp what is meant by "pattern of organization." If you then contrast this scene with what goes on in the family, for example, you will appreciate what is meant by the school being a kind of institution sharply marked off from any other form of social organization.  
The three characteristics just mentioned fix the aims and methods of instruction and discipline. The main purpose or objective is to prepare the young for future responsibilities and for success in life, by means of acquisition of the organized bodies of information and prepared forms of skill which comprehend the material of instruction. Since the subject-matter as well as standards of proper conduct are handed down from the past, the attitude of pupils must, upon the whole, be one of docility, receptivity, and obedience.  
- Experience and Education by John Dewey (1938).

I should add: John Dewey stresses (in more and better words than this) that in its opposition to tradition - progressive education must not reject all aspects of the traditional method. His advise was sobering as I vainly imagined the potential outcomes of the discussions before they had begun.

> [The idea of community education] leads to a different concept of the school. It is no longer an isolated building surrounded by playgrounds and fences. It is instead a community facility, set among the shops and public buildings in the centre of a district. […] The daily lives of the community and its children are inextricably mixed, just as they were for most people all through history.  
- Places for Learning in Talking Schools by Colin Ward (1987).

An important lesson that I took from working on this project was that the assumptions I make about the world, as I sit reading alone, are generally misguided. I find myself imagining these new schools emerging from some project that I am thinking about doing. But they already exist. These facilities that Colin Ward describes - directed at children and adults - can be found all over and they have a similar purpose to those institutions described by Noam Chomsky above. They develop from within communities to, in part, fill the gap left by the lack of participation in the democratic process that people desire.

> … the educational system as it is presently organized, is a form of regressive taxation, which tends to disadvantage further the disadvantaged, and to provide relief for those already privileged and better-off.  
- Deschooling Revisited by Ian Lister (1976).

For me, it is this argument that explains de-schooling. The inequity of the system demands its total transformation. For my own sake, I have tried to explain what deschooling is - as I understand it. The system (in Britain, for instance)  is unequal: some are given no education; many are given a standard education up to secondary level; some of these go on to further education; some of these go on to higher education; and a few go beyond this. This might not be the exact definition of how the elite ruling class is constructed but it is one aspect of it. As we follow the path, upwards, through the system each student receives more and more support from the state: someone who has been educated to degree level has received, in the course of their education, more state subsidy than someone who left school at sixteen.

This process, by which those at or near the top receive greater benefit from the educational system, is reproduced in the classroom where students who, for whatever reason, do better, by some standard, than their fellow pupils are given more attention by teachers and the school through a class system that divides students according to their apparent abilities. Their class status, as in social class, is also a factor in this, sometimes subtle, sometimes overt.

On the surface this might seem to be an argument for tuition fees in higher education but this is no solution. The solution, as far as I understand it from reading a little bit of Ivan Illich’s writing, is that the education system ought to be restructured to provide each person with the same standard and level of education. However, if the system works as described above then it would be financially impossible to educate each and every person up to the level of higher education, and so… deschooling. Less school.

I think the suggestion is that schooling provides children and young adults with a depth and breadth of knowledge, in such a variety of subjects, that is unnecessary for their personal development - unless they are being developed to become mere tools in a factory. Learning should not, therefore, be restricted but rather adapted to each individual’s desires and requirements.

> There is no intrinsic reason why the education that schools are now failing to provide could not be acquired more successfully in the setting of the family, of work and communal activity, in new kinds of libraries and other centers that would provide the means of learning.  
- School: The Sacred Cow in Celebration of Awareness by Ivan Illich (1969-1970)

Ali, who lives on the estate, came to several of the meetings and we had good conversations about his experiences of being a teacher and of learning about different forms of education. He expressed a need for a place that young people can go to after school to do their homework because they do not have the space or privacy at home to do it. It would also, he thought, give them somewhere to go instead of hanging around on the street. He also said that ESOL classes - English for Speakers of Other Languages - would be well received by people in the area. A local organisation runs an office that small affinity groups can use for administration tasks and a church nearby holds an after-school homework-club but, Ali said, it is very busy and his children are turned away if it is full.

I posted flyers through doors on the estate and took some to a few local organisations. All of this helped me to realise that, with my project, I had shamefully underestimated the people living in the community who had already done the work that I had hoped to instigate. The community had created the institutions that Ivan Illich, Colin Ward, and Noam Chomsky are talking about and whilst they had not solved everyone’s problems and they might not be as radical and progressive as my imagination naively extends they are part of the structure that supports people in their efforts to organise.

I did not talk to Ali about this but; I worry that an after-school homework-club would have to work hard to not restrict young people's independence in the same way that school does. And whilst I do not particularly look forward to walking past groups of teenagers on the street in case they take the piss out of my hair or something, I would rather that they were outside talking to each other than inside - perpetuating the problems of the present system. I do not think Ali would have disagreed had I said this at the time.

> There are huge efforts that go into making people, to borrow Adam Smith's phrase, "as stupid and ignorant as it's possible for a human being to be." A lot of the educational system is designed for that, if you think about it, it's designed for obedience and passivity. From childhood, a lot of it is designed to prevent people from being independent and creative. If you're independent minded in school, you're probably going to get in trouble very early on. That’s not the trait that's being preferred or cultivated …  
- Class Warfare - Interviews with Noam Chomsky by David Barsamian (1995).

I am not really sure where I am heading with all of this. I do not think I had intended to come to a conclusion. I am making plans to start an evening-class at a community centre near my studio and a lot of what I have learned from doing all of this reading in preparation for the discussions is helping me to prepare for that. The Latymer Project education project failed in its major aims because of my inability to talk with people - in spite of my desire for discussion. As I posted leaflets about the meetings through about twelve hundred doors on the Silchester West Estate I spoke to three or four people and I did not try to talk about the project at all. For discussion to engender discussion it needs to begin and I hopefully can convince myself of the need for that when I go out posting leaflets for this evening class. I will let you know how it goes.

This bit of writing could continue on into the night with some internal (and a little bit of external) discussion about whether or not to rely on the old institutions or to work towards creating new ones. I might never get around to writing it.
