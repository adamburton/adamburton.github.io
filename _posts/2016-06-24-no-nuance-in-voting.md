title: No nuance in voting

I do not have many conversations with friends and family about politics but I did talk about the EU Referendum a fair bit. I had a long conversation with my mum, and two men on a train asked me if I was in or out and we had a brief chat. Some friends have mentioned that they have been talking with people about it. I think this is really positive and I wonder if the need to talk about it is a consequence of the lack of serious discussion in the mass media.

Whenever I heard interviews on BBC Radio 4 about the EU Referendum what stood out to me was that:

 - the debate was between two factions of the Conservative Party and therefore limited to their (right wing) interests
 - the Conservative Party’s serious internal divisions were not discussed
 - there was little or no substance, discussion was about how much everyone was lying or scaremongering

I assume that this is reflected across the spectrum of the national corporate media in the UK.

My feelings about how to vote were not at all clear and I think that, if I were to have proper conversations with people about it, they would feel the same lack of a clear understanding. When I spoke with my mum it seemed to me that, whilst she knew how she wanted to vote, her understanding of the situation was as confused as my own. She said that politicians being interviewed on the news “say nothing” and that it was impossible to make any sense between two politicians arguing. This again highlights the limited debate and lack of serious discussion that is being imposed on our understanding of the situation.

A friend, whose father was Greek, and who has visited Greece several times recently, voted Leave. As I understood it, she wanted to express her contempt for the European Union and felt that if Britain exited then some kind of positive change would be forced upon the EU and, down the line, this would help the people of Greece (and Britain and the rest of Europe). I think she was right to act on her principles but it seems to me that the heartfelt nuance of her argument is lost in the process. Again, given the limits of the debate—which are imposed by the media, which represents establishment interests—the results represent only the opinions of the two factions of the Conservative Party.

This lack of nuance is, I think, an intentional part of the political process. There is almost no popular participation in British representative democracy and when I read a newspaper or watch the news I get the sense that the media would like to keep it that way. We learn about what is going on but we are treated as outsiders to the process. It might seem as though the EU Referendum is a rare opportunity for the electorate to have a say in politics but it is not really much of a say. We are permitted only one word: Leave or Remain.

So, we are not allowed to express our opinions in a meaningful way and our one word response will be misinterpreted.

I did not vote (my housing situation is a bit weird and I could not be bothered to sort it out in time). I regret that a bit but I am not certain that I would have voted even if I could have—and I am not sure if I would have voted Leave or Remain. Like most people I do not participate in politics and it seems daft to vote but then do nothing to help create what I have voted for (I do not mean to criticise “most people” in that sense—as I have tried to suggest, the system does not encourage or even really allow our participation).

I have to go to sleep but I will try to add more to this over the weekend. I want to talk about alternatives, in fact I would rather that solving these problems was the focus of what I am saying but if I do not post this now then I never will. And I feel like that last paragraph is a bit stupid. Never mind.
