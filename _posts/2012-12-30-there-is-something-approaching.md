In many ways I am a great deal further with the Something Else project than I was the last time that I thought about writing about how badly it is going. But in another way - that I think might supersede all of the other ways - I am not printing the paper, I am not handing something out in the street, I am not organising discussions and so I am no further than I was eighteen months ago when I told myself that I had to get on with it. Some things have happened: I am reading a slightly more than ordinary amount of news related to UK foreign policy. I am fascinated by it. I am learning and changing. But I am not printing the paper.

I have tried to remind myself of one thing all of the way through this but it has persistently evaded my thoughts, leading to these moments of concern: the web site is a notebook for notes of the articles that I have read. I post it on-line for the sake of it - to share the notes. It is not the end and it is not of any concern that anyone ought to look at it.

When I first thought about all of this my intention was to get information off of the web because it seems to me that whilst it is on there it has to be sought out. It only represents a threat to the present system if we go looking for it and whilst it might be true that more people are looking for it than in the past there are still people reading terrible corporate newspapers, worthless free-sheets*. Having time to develop the knowledge required for democracy to function remains a privilege.

I think that a problem with the web is that it offers an easier alternative to the work of organising in our communities. I am far removed from the world of political activism and am in no place to comment on these matters in such a general way but I know from my small personal experience of trying to work towards community organising that the temptation to put all of my energy into making a web site (instead of going out into the world**), because it allows me to sit at home, is almost totally overwhelming. I am struggling now to undo the effects of it. Recently I had the first thought flash through my mind about deciding to give up making the newspaper. I was in a half sleep, sort of, imagining cleaning the cab of a lorry, brightening up the chrome and the blue surface in the sunshine. And someone asked me how the paper is going and I said "No, I gave it up." It is quite shattering now when I think about it but at the time it was a perfectly casual thought about something in amongst all of the others. It seems as though this feeling has come about, partly, because of the web site. It is a lot of work and it has distracted me from the real work of printing the newspaper. So I am trying to minimise that side of the work, the web site, to see how much of the problem it is.

The problem might have more to do with what motivates me towards the work. I wish that I knew what it is that I have to see or read or think that would help me to realise how important it is that I print the paper. Not for its purpose - its purpose is to soak up cat urine - but important for me to do the work that I want to do. Important for me to work towards organising, democracy, anarchism. It feels like that in the past when I made a decision to work towards something I had an experience or a thought that was significant to me, for whatever reason, and it helped me towards the decision, likely in some fundamental way. It is probable that I attribute these moments to more of the thoughts / decisions than is true but I am confident that it has happened like that on a few occasions. And here I feel as though for me to convince myself that I have to print the paper is going to take some terrible injustice that I have to react against. But I know that every link posted to the web site during the last eighteen months has documented a terrible injustice that ought to move me to action. So I cannot use that as some sort of excuse, it would be pathetic. Whatever it is that will take hold of me and force me to do something exists outside of the work that I am doing.

(There is something approaching and it is an important time. I should prepare myself to get the reason for the project in to hands.)

*I think there is something to be said for independence in writing, journalism, and publishing. I make a newspaper and that newspaper represents my interests, obviously. It might not be so simple but I think this points stands: if I had the money to make a newspaper with national or global circulation I would have a different set of interests to those I have today and those interests would be in the command of capital, mine and my fellow capitalists and the newspaper would continue to represent my interests. Individual journalists might be able to carve out some form of independence from within a large institution but I do not think that this is enough, it does not justify the terrible things that the institution does.

For instance, a couple of days ago I read an article on CagePrisoners about the Somali born, former British citizen Mahdi Hashi who had disappeared earlier this year from Somalia and re-appeared this month in a New York courthouse. Mahdi’s British citizenship has been revoked by the Home Secretary, Theresa May, meaning that the British government is not obliged to question his rendition. Given the last ten or so years of protest that the British government has faced in extraditing British citizens to the United States it seems possible that the revocation of Mahdi’s citizenship was part of a deliberate plot to avoid the extradition process, which is already heavily weighted against the rights of individuals. The article was written by a staff writer at the Daily Mail and had been reproduced on the CagePrisoners web site. My mum reads the Daily Mail and I wish she did not but she might have read that article by that unnamed staff writer and whilst it makes me glad to know that someone is doing good work there it does not make me think that the rest of it is okay, a means to an end, or something. The same goes for The Guardian: the occasional brilliant commentary article does not excuse the destructive consumerism promoted throughout - which is certainly a function of the newspaper.
(See Media Lens for some useful information.)

So I am generally more interested in what independent journalists, citizen journalists, bloggers, and such, have to say than their corporate-media counterparts and I want the work that I do to encourage movement away from those institutions so that they can be forced to change by popular pressure and so that the value of independent media is better recognised.

**I suppose that ten years ago it would have been acceptable to casually refer to the internet and the world wide web as a different place to the world, a sort of computer game world in which time spent has no effect in reality. It might have been a stupid thing to say but it would not have been totally detached from the experiences of many. Today, most of us will have experienced or witnessed events in the world for which communication via the internet has been an integral part. These events have made the internet a part of the world but I think that the integration is over-emphasised.

In a functioning democracy we would have control of our lives, we would govern our own lives, and we would work collectively to organise the infrastructure in a way that supports everyone and represents everyone’s interests and needs. This collectivisation would operate at a local, regional, and global level. At all levels of the infrastructure we would communicate via the internet, obviously, and it is amazing. But I am not convinced that such forms of communication offered by the internet (as presently exist or might come to exist) can replace direct, verbal, visual, whatever, communication between us, particularly at the local level. Media (those things that mediate between us and what is happening in the world: television, newspapers, the web), which represent the interests of established power, actively contribute to the undoing and atomisation of our communities. At the local level, for democracy to function, for community to exist, work has to go on that brings people together in physical communication and whilst I am not saying that everyone who uses the web to put information out into the world is thereby contributing to this atomisation and must be neglecting physical communication I have experienced the way in which the web can distract from that kind of work that I think is just as necessary, if not more so. And so I am keen to make a distinction between the two worlds - on-line (OL) and real-life (RL) - as a way of pointing towards the importance of physical communication, face to face meetings, discussion, reading from paper, and objects and things.
