title: Fox Art Licks Vulpes Vulpes text
---

At some time during the winter of 2010 I wrote some or all of this on my phone when I was walking from Clapton to Kingsland in the evening. It was made for the Vulpes Vulpes contribution to Art Licks printed magazine (issue two).  
For the best part of an hour I have been replacing all of the spaces in the text with spaces that are highlit yellow. For that reason only I am putting this here as a PDF file. Perhaps in another time I will put it here with the spaces highlit yellow using HTML.
