The old web site is still here but you have to look for it—there are no links. The site has two sections each with its own component parts. One is the blog with blog posts. The other is collections of pages for different things that I do.

I decided to make a new web site partly because all of the information on my previous web site was outdated. I am proud of some of the work that I have made and I wanted to go through it all and re-invigorate it somehow. I also wanted to change the design and structure of the site (I had intended to build the structure around associations between thekeywords for each page but I could not work out how to do it).

It took me a long time to find the right software to build the site on. The experience of learning about flat-file Content Management Systems and all of that bullshit has been emotionally draining at times. I am glad that I did it though—mostly because it has helped me to learn about Github. I decided to use Jekyll on Github Pages. I cannot be bothered to explain what that is. It does not really matter. The software makes it very easy to combine a blog with the 'static' elements of the site (once you learn how to use the software).

Some of the blog posts are from my old blog. I want to write more and more often.
