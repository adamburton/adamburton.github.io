Ben and I jammed this out in 2013. He had been watching a documentary called Four Hours in My Lai and had recorded a sample of a man named Varnado Simpson talking about his experiences of war and life after the war.

I think this is one of our best numbers. I think that, somehow, we managed to use Varnado's words in a respectful way, without making lite of his experiences. The mood of it is just right.
