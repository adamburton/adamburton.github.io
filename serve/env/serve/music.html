    <p>I make music with two friends, Ben and Lee, in a band named <em>White Tantrum</em>. We started off as a sort of rubbish-punk outfit and for quite a while we have been a bad-noise duo because Lee lives in a different city. Recently Lee has been visiting more and we are trying to get organised. Mostly we make bad-noise.</p>

<p>I am going to post some of our numbers here and maybe try to explain what is going on. A lot of the music that we make is embarrassing but really good at the same time. It is un-listenable.</p>

<p>We have been playing together for about ten years and we have only performed live twice. If you like our music please book us for a gig.</p>
