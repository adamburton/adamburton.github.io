    <p>For one month I will be preparing an article for the forthcoming Decalcomania exhibition. The article will be based on the book Damming the Flood: Haiti and the Politics of Containment by Peter Hallward. During this month I will be reading two things. One will be Damming the Flood, again. The other will be a selection of articles about Haiti, written by Peter Hallward that have appeared in a variety of journals and which are available on the web. As I make my way through the articles I will be making attempts at writing up my notes for on here.</p>

<p>The purpose of the article that I am preparing will be to encourage those who read it to read Damming the Flood. The purpose of my preparing will be to condense in a, hopefully, not too pathetic way what I take to be two of the main themes of the book: i) correcting misrepresentation of popular democratic governance in Haiti and ii) the use of foreign aid by former colonial powers as a tool to prohibit Haiti’s independence. (I will be trying to explain here, sometime, why I think that reading Damming the Flood constitutes a valid and worthwhile form of support for the people of Haiti.)</p>

<p>During the exhibition I will be handing out copies of the article in PensAnts and holding some meetings to discuss the article and Haiti. The title of the article (and this post) is a quote of Jean-Bertrande Aristide, from an interview with Peter Hallward.</p>
