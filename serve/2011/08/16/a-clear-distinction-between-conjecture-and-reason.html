    <p>I am concerned that I should not be publishing my thoughts here. I am concerned that you might think that it is pathetic. I feel compelled to do it. And because I feel compelled to do it I have made an attempt to explain what it is that I think moves the compulsion forward. I would not want you, or anyone, to think that I think that I have something to say that you ought to be interested in. There is something about the act of publishing that makes a person seem that sort of person. It may seem facile to deny that I think that I have something to say that you ought to be interested in. However, I have given it some thought and I do not believe that that is entirely the case. As follows.</p>

<p>If you spend some of your time writing out what it is that you are thinking it might help you to develop your opinions and feelings and it might help you to make reasoned arguments if you try to distinguish between your opinions and those reasoned arguments. If you write them down and put them out here it might seem as though you think that they are of some particular worth. You think that they have worth in having the potential to join discussion of their topic.</p>

<p>There are two reasons to write here, then. One is for your own sake and another is for the sake of discussion. There is a third sake in that, if you can make a reasoned argument, that reasoned argument ought to be based on facts, and that reasoned argument ought to, then, be of some use, if it contains useful, rational, reasoned arguments based on facts.</p>

<p>Is it not the point that you, that you want opinion to be recognised as such, pointless, so that you can be relaxed about expressing your opinions, so that you can show how plastic opinion is and that it should be valued as such, trusted as such? That is what you said: your opinion alongside your reasoning. You am interested in solidity too. You can explain yourself by spending time writing out what you are thinking and what you are arguing to make the clear distinction between conjecture and reason.</p>
