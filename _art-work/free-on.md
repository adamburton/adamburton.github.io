We do each others things.
"We wanted to find a way of deferring responsibility for any decisions we might have reached individually whilst making art. And have contrived a system by which we tell each other what work to make. The time taken talking about it, the fractured means of conversation (i.e. online document exchange, sms text, email), and allowing synchronicity to act as an occasional arbiter in the development of ideas has caused the finished works to stray from the proscriptive directions we gave each other at the outset. This exhibition is the product of our collaborations."
