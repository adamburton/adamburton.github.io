an exhibition at Fishmarket, Northampton in 2011 (part of The Tyranny of Grammar festival) The aim of the exhibition was to create a comfortable environment for discussions about enclosure and its consequences: migration, eviction, homelessness, displacement. Due to constraints of time and my inexperience the discussions were (almost entirely) unattended. However, most of the handouts were taken by visitors.
PDF versions of the handouts and links to sources are below. Links to films that were shown during the exhibition are also below.
Thank you Andrea, Anita, Barbara, Carla, Catherine, Helen, John, John, Kaavous, Laura, Lu li, Rachael, Rebecca, Reuben, Richard, Sally, Subir, Surbhi, Tamsyn, & Tanya.
