title: Acceptable Answers (greyboards)
year: 2009
short-description: notices of imagined scenes of climate change
---

One day, after visiting Freedom Bookshop in Whitechapel I was looking through the bins at the Aldgate Press for some materials to print on. I found some greyboard, which had been used as padding on pallets of paper.

I was reading The Road by Cormac McCarthy and a book about UK Green Party policy. I was thinking about climate change and about awful, terrible things and I decided to write some of it down and to print the writing onto the greyboard with a rubber stamp letter set that my friend Richard Lawrence gave me.

There was a quote in the Green Party book: "We have not time to find acceptable answers." I found this deeply unsettling and decided to name the printing project after it. The quote was of Garret Hardin. At the time I was quite concerned about over-population but later I read more about it, thought more about it, and became more concerned with over-consumption.

I took some photographs of the three greyboards that I had printed and sent them as part of an application to EAST International in Norwich, along with some photos of my Broadsides letterpress posters. My application was accepted and I ended up making another ten or so of the greyboard prints.

EAST International was an important exhibition for me. I made a lot of friends in Norwich and it gave me some confidence to continue being an artist.

Something I noticed about the greyboards is that some people would stand reading them for quite a long time. I hoped that the work expressed my concerns about climate change in a way that resonated with people. The possibility of doing that was exciting. But I had no idea what effect it was having on people. The ambiguity of that made the work feel, at the time, kind of pointless. I did not feel like I was doing enough to change anything, to raise awareness. It was just a poem on a wall in a room.
