Some friends of mine run this wonderful arts organisation called [Vulpes Vulpes](http://vulpesvulpes.org/). They were doing a residency, making an exhibition, and having workshops at [Airspace Gallery](http://www.airspacegallery.org/index.php/projects/parlour_a_vulpes_vulpes_residency) in Stoke-on-Trent. They asked me to write about their project. What I wrote went up on the wall during the exhibition and a year later they used it in book  about Vulpes Vulpes called [*Go To Ground*](http://vulpesvulpes.org/book/).

 > … whatever social structures and arrangements are developed, they ought to maximize the possibilities for people to pursue their own creative potential and you can’t make a formula for that. People are too different and they ought to be different and the differences ought to be encouraged …  
 Noam Chomsky interviewed by Barry Pateman, 2004

I seem to want to try to quantify the value of something in terms of its political effectiveness, or its effect in creating political change—but I do not think that it can be done. Something can be documented and analysed but only personal conclusions can be made concerning what it did to change the world because those effects might be regarded as positive or negative depending on the point of view. And because the world and the people in it are so complex it seems unlikely that the causes of political change can be fully understood since it is brought about by so many individuals making decisions based on a variety of information and influences.

When I think about what something does in the world, an art-work for instance, I do not feel comfortable saying that it does nothing or it does this much. And in the same way, some other form of political activism, writing a letter, for instance, to a politician, or organising an anti-war march cannot have its effectiveness quantified. I can look at it and try to decide whether or not I think it did something, anything, but I cannot prove it.

For me, spending two or three weeks walking around a new place talking to strangers, making friends, finding and cataloguing random objects, and organising gatherings, buffets, children’s craft workshops, would be too informal and ephemeral to satisfy my political concerns. I want ‘social’ art to *be the change I want to see in the world* - a meaningful democracy - and, for me, that begins with lively political discussion developing into popular control over decision making. But there is as much value in sharing food and music with one another as there is in political discussion—it seems less important now because political power is such a dominating force over society. These kinds of activities and events are as legitimate as any other. Also, think about what influences a person to action. It might be years of education or it might be a seemingly meaningless conversation about rave nostalgia. The outcomes of these activities are - like the causes of political change - impossible to determine.

All the same, I can look at the work being done and make a subjective analysis of it based on my understanding of the situation and my goals and desires. And I can make assumptions about potential outcomes. But the analysis is of more use if it has some kind of direct experience to support it—it cannot only come out of the vacuum of thought or theory. The process of creating a different world happens *in the world* and the different ways that different people approach such a task must be tried out and experienced - by everyone involved. An artist residency that has an explicit social purpose is as much about personal development as it is about social development.
