"Let us take the Foucauldian definition of biopolitics as a starting point. The term "biopolitics"" indicates the way power, at a certain point, transforms itself to govern not only individuals, through a certain number of disciplinary processes, but also humanity constituted in "populations." Biopolitics (through local biopowers) is thus concerned with the management of health, hygiene, food, birth rate, sexuality, etc., as these various fields of intervention become political stakes. In this way, biopolitics starts to engage with all the aspects of life that will become the arena for welfare state policies: its development is in fact wholly taken up in the attempt to better manage the labor force. Let us listen to Foucault on this point: "The discovery of population is, simultaneous to the discovery of the individual and the trainable (dressable) body, the other great technological node around which the political processes of the West have evolved."

Biopolitics is based, therefore, on principles that develop the technologies of capitalism and sovereignty: these principles that are greatly modified, in time, through their evolution from a disciplinarian form to one that adjoins to discipline the mechanisms of control. Whereas discipline was an "anatamo-politics" of bodies and essentially applied to individuals, biopolitics on the contrary represents a kind of great “social medicine” attempting the control of populations in order to govern their life: life now belongs to power."

"A term Foucault introduced in 1976 which names configurations of power relations that concern themselves not with exercising the old sovereign’s right to put subjects to death or demand the sacrifice of their lives in war but, rather, with exercising the power to make human beings live. Networks of biopower are institutionalised relations and practices that function to oversee, regulate, and direct populations so as to increase or decrease fertility and longevity, manage public health and mortality, control epidemics and maintain living environments. Biopolitical strategies may include governmental programmes for public hygiene, state- or corporate-sponsored campaigns to improve workers’ morals and physical fitness, mandatory vaccinations, tax or age incentives for marriage and family planning, state regulation of fertility; public surveillance and crime
management, insurance, and a host of related social and economic programmes. Biopower emerges out of normalised disciplinary power in the nineteenth century; it differs from disciplinary power in that it does not focus on individuals (as disciplinary power does) except as members of populations, but the two types of power are complementary in the development of contemporary forms of state and corporate management of human lives. Foucault discusses biopower in Part V of The History of Sexuality, Volume. One (1980) and chapter 11 of ‘Society Must Be Defended’ (2003). In both texts, he links the rise of biopower with the rise of state racism in the twentieth century, suggesting that the imperative to manage populations typically involves or leads to a desire to 'purify' them."

"QUESTION: It seems to me, with a certain degree of difference, that the concept of a virtual senate is similar to Negri’s and Hardt’s concept of Empire. [Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, Empire (Harvard University Press, 2000)]

CHOMSKY: Empire, yes, but I have to say I found it hard to read. I understood only parts, and what I understood seemed to me pretty well known and expressible much more simply. However, maybe I missed something important.

QUESTION: Yes, and the book arrives to the same conclusion as yours but through a more complicated, less readable way...

CHOMSKY: If people get something out of it, it’s okay. What I understand seems to be pretty simple, and this is not a criticism. I don’t see any need to say in a complicated way what you can say in an easier way. You can make things look complicated, that's part of the game that intellectuals play; things must look complicated. You might not be conscious about that, but it’s a way of gaining prestige, power and influence.

QUESTION: Do you look at Foucault's work in this perspective?

CHOMSKY: Foucault is an interesting case because I’m sure he honestly wants to undermine power but I think with his writings he reinforced it. The only way to understand Foucault is if you are a graduate student or you are attending a university and have been trained in this particular style of discourse. That's a way of guaranteeing, it might not be his purpose, but that's a way of guaranteeing that intellectuals will have power, prestige and influence. If something can be said simply, say it simply, so that the carpenter next door can understand you. Anything that is at all well understood about human affairs is pretty simple. I find Foucault really interesting but I remain skeptical of his mode of expression. I find that I have to decode him, and after I have decoded him, maybe I'm missing something. I don't get the significance of what I am left with. I have never effectively understood what he was talking about. I mean, when I try to take the big words he uses and put them into words that I can understand and use, it is difficult for me to accomplish this task. It all strikes me as overly convoluted and very abstract. But what happens when you try to skip down to real cases? The trouble with Foucault, and with this certain kind of theory, arises when it tries to come down to earth. Really, nobody was able to explain to me the importance of his work..."

"... Foucault's work allows us to recognize the biopolitical nature of the new paradigm of power.(2) Biopower is a form of power that regulates social life from its interior, following it, interpreting it, absorbing it, and rearticulating it. Power can achieve an effective command over the entire life of the population only when it becomes an integral, vital function that every individual embraces and reactivatcs of his or her own accord. As Foucault says, "Life has now become ... an object of power." (3) The highest function of this power is to invest life through and through, and its primary task is to administer life. Biopower thus refers to a situation in which what is directly at stake in power is the production and reproduction of life itself."

These figures show "the percentage of registered voters who actually voted excluding votes deliberately or accidentally spoiled." Other years: 1997: 71.4, 1992: 77.7, 1987: 75.3, 1983: 72.7.

I have attempted to find out who said "no matter who you vote for the government always wins" on the web. It is often attributed to 'anarchists' and I found one reference to Emma Goldman. My search was not exhaustive.

"Social and political scientists could not help noticing during the years of New Labour Government that its policies converged with those of its Tory predecessors. ... In industrial policy, training, education, pensions, crime, [is] found an almost complete convergence ... [the Tories] cannot do anything about any of these major issues and the more New Labour endorses and carries out Tory policies, the more hopelessly shackled the Tory Party becomes. Convergence is disastrous for everyone in a democratic society, ... Though both parties and their spokespeople made every effort during the general election of 2001 to concentrate of their differences, convergence kept creeping back onto the agenda. The electorate got the point at once. Labour won the election by another massive majority. But their vote (10.7 million) was dramatically lower not just on 1997. ... The Tory vote was down too, and so was the Liberal Democrat vote. Indeed the most striking feature of the voting figures in 2001 was the huge numbers of voters who did not vote. With the single exception of 1918, when the vote had just been granted and the people were recovering from a ghastly and pointless world war, there never was a time when fewer people used their right to vote than in 2001."

"... now for the producer; I mean the real producer, the worker; how does this scramble for the plunder of the market affect him? The manufacturer, in the eagerness of his war, has had to collect into one neighbourhood a vast army of workers, he has drilled them till they are as fit as may be for his special branch of production, that is, for making a profit out of it, and with the result of their being fit for nothing else..."

Words Regarding Biopower.

I am writing about this word: biopower. - In the context of the premise that: the concept of biopower can have cognitive affect as both a concept explained - its definition irrespective of the word, and a concept - the word alone with an implicit definition defined in the head. Also I am asking: is the suggestion manifest without the word? I do not intend to convince with my answer or to get anywhere. Though I might. I want only to write about biopower. I wonder: the philosophical vernacular serves whom?

As with everything, political philosophy has terminology and in the midst of that body of specialized words we may encounter innumerable layers of complication. These dialects are open to interpretation but their explicit meaning and significance is informed by a wealth of secondary resource inaccessible to those not fortunate enough to have been suitably educated.

My grasp of the term biopower(1) is not total. It is framed with several particular citations, which restrict - by choice - for the purposes of this writing, my capacity for the lingua franca of political philosophy.

My own denotation and subsequent connotations of the locution biopower(2) are infused with and influenced by the opinion that convoluted and coiled lingo can be used as a means toward the establishment of power(3). I am writing of this confluence.

I think that the significance of a word can someways be conveyed by its context. Moreover, the task of realising the meaning, purpose, and use of 'biopower'(4) was necessarily a part of my eventual perception of the word. However I do not think that the process should be prerequisite, for it is not the function of language to obscure thought.

61.4 percent of the UK electorate voted in the general election of 2005, an increase of two percent on the previous election(5). Allow me to suppose that the inclination to not vote, though commonly disregarded as voter apathy is, opposingly, a conscious choice. I feel as though said demographic might be with the (anarchist?) aphorism "no matter who you vote for the government always wins"(6), and on that basis I reason the group do recognise that whichever of the political parties vying to manage capitalism(7) succeeds at taking power their government will keep the population alive. It might be slightly more or slightly less grim depending on which side of the central point of convergence(8) that politico set is positioned but all the same we will be permitted to live - and thereby work - until permitted to perish. I believe abstention to be an acknowledgement of the truism that the majority of human beings are compelled to sell their labour "and so enable the capitalist to play his game,"(9) and an awareness of the concept of biopower.(10)
