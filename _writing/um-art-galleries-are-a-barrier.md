title: Um, art galleries are a barrier
year: 2013
short-description: In amongst all of the excitement and joy of contemporary art and regeneration the problems that capitalist society imposes on institutions are being forgotten or ignored.

My friend Mandy asked me to write something for a book that she was making with the Associate Artist scheme at Firstsite Gallery in Colchester. I wrote this. It is now two years old. It was printed in a book but the designers neglected to include the footnote about privilege. I have not spoken to Mandy in ages so I do not know if the books were ever distributed.

Solidarity, 

Um. Art galleries are a barrier. They purposefully alienate the majority of the public so as to keep them out and away from art. The people who run art galleries are complicit in this process, all of them. Art galleries, and the people who run them, destroy the lives of the people they want to keep out. Art galleries exist for this exact purpose. In this sense, art galleries are like almost all institutions formed and operating in capitalist society. Due to the nature of their surroundings they come to resemble the institution of capitalism; they are inherently undemocratic.  
(All art galleries have white walls. All of their floors are painted grey - once a year, someone kicks over a bucket of grey paint and pushes it around with a mop. They paint themselves out of the room and then disappear. The people who work for art galleries are invisible and neutral.)

This is well understood. For some these intentions are explicit. For others the situation, whilst regrettable, is an inevitable and therefore acceptable feature of the process by which art is commissioned / made and viewed / consumed. I do not have any empirical evidence for any of this. I only feel like that it is so.  
For instance, not a single commercial art gallery in East London has a sign on the door saying that it is an art gallery, I reckon - Project Spaces are no better.  
Eastside Projects in Birmingham, recently explained on Twitter: "Art is not a democratic process. Commissioning art can be. It is not very often based on consensus. It is based on faith, sense & intuition." - i.e. an elite, educated group of artists, curators, critics, or whoever, know what is best for the other public. Firstsite Gallery in Colchester has an Associate Artist scheme that employs artists to counteract the negative effects of all of the other work that goes on at the gallery.

That last one is the starting point for whatever this is. Obviously, what I have said is mindlessly provocative. There are individuals and organisations, a great deal of work goes on that wants to undermine the barrier of art galleries. It is the responsibility of artists to share the privilege accorded to them by their status in society.* That is not to say that I expect people to do this, rather that it is something that anyone would automatically do given the opportunity. But the whole world is stacked against us and the atomising, destructive effects of the present economic system are constantly suggesting that there is no point in trying. That is not to say that to share ones privilege is a brave and heroic act, it is just a decision that a person makes and they see how it goes.

On the 24th of July 2013, as part of Firstsite's Associate Artist Enquiries event, Mandy Roberts took the assembled audience on a tour of the Firstsite building. We passed through a catering cupboard, offices, back corridors, and plant rooms. Each door marked a boundary between a different type of space. Mandy had a master key round her neck. As we approached each boundary Mandy made a different declaration about the effects of "Pushing Boundaries" and pushed through the door. "Pushing Boundaries Creates New Structures!", "Pushing Boundaries Is Part Of Evolution! ... " We piled through behind.

I am not going to attempt to use Mandy's tour as a metaphor for my crude and cynical explanation of what I think art galleries do. Any interpretation of the work becomes meaningless as soon as any other interpretation is introduced that, quite easily, contradicts whatever point I might attempt to make. The same can be said for any political activity. We do not know how to act in the world without doing something wrong. And, remember, no political art-work ever did anything to change anything.

Firstsite, the building, is a big curve and the top is wider than the bottom. Outside the entrance is a large paved area. It is not a busy thoroughfare, it is, sort of, round the back of some other places. There is a low wall around some plants that serves as a long bench. There are some large steps that also make good seating and if you rub a candle, or something, on the edge of the steps you can do a trick on your skateboard called a grind, or something. Then skin your elbow.

As part of the Experimental Communities programme at Firstsite, Mandy works with some of the people who use the courtyard outside the gallery as a social space. Together, they have formed a group called Young Art Kommunity. Mandy says that Y.A.K. members "are not from art backgrounds or particularly interested in Contemporary Art. ... The group has become actively involved in programming events, and activities for others in collaboration with firstsite artists and staff." One of the group's aims is to have a part in the governance of the gallery. It is an on-going, long-term project that is constantly changing. Mandy works to support the group's attempts to have their concerns and desires represented within the institution that they have fallen involved with because of, amongst other things I suppose, a lack of adequate social space elsewhere in the city. On the day of the tour Colchester Council were fixing metal studs into the edge of the steps outside.

In each of the two Learning Rooms of Firstsite there are two small alcoves above some cupboards. In the alcoves Mandy has put a vinyl sign that looks like cross-stitched text, but bigger. In one room on the left side, in green vinyl, it reads OUR SPACE and on the right, in red vinyl, YOUR SPACE. In the other room on the left side, in green vinyl, it reads YOUR SPACE and on the right, in red vinyl, OUR SPACE.

Mandy's attempts to explain the dynamics of the building mark the distinction between so-called 'public space' and private space. Part of the problem is that the notion of a public art gallery is fatuous if the gallery and the artists whose work is presented within it do not work towards making the gallery truly public. There is an assumption made that because the doors are open everyone is welcome. More realistically - there are clear demarcations based along lines of age, class, ethnicity, education, and social status that everyone implicitly understands and adheres to. Alongside the assumption, there is a belief that if people are not "interested in Contemporary Art" then they can go somewhere else but that is not good enough if a claim is being made that art does something positive in the world. Art does do something positive but it can be rather selective about who benefits.

The work that Mandy is doing with Y.A.K. is important and worthwhile. But the outcomes of this work are all ephemeral and ever-lasting. The conversations and dancing are quickly forgotten and life-changing. I cannot describe them because of that and because they are, like, a decision, just a thought that someone has that makes them maybe act in a certain way. It is much easier for me to focus on all of the negative effects of the bigger machine because it helps to feed my own skepticism and some sense I have of a collective skepticism towards art galleries that do not serve the function that they claim to serve.

I do think what I said before about art galleries but not in the way that I said it. I said it like that because I needed a way to write it down at first, somewhere to begin from and from there I have to step back and look at it and say that I do not mean it like that. What I mean is that there are problems and I am worried that in amongst all of the excitement and joy of contemporary art and regeneration the problems are being forgotten or ignored.

In the 1790s Wilhelm von Humboldt, liberal philosopher and educationalist, defined the privilege of the artist, in the context of the emancipation of all work, thus:

> "An interesting man [sic], therefore, is interesting in all situations and all activities, though he only attains the most matured and graceful consummation of his activity, when his way of life is harmoniously in keeping with his character. In view of this consideration, it seems as if all peasants and craftsmen might be elevated into artists; that is, men who love their labour for its own sake, improve it by their own plastic genius and inventive skill, and thereby cultivate their intellect, ennoble their character, and exalt and refine their pleasures. And so humanity would be ennobled by the very things which now, though beautiful in themselves, so often serve to degrade it."  
 Wilhelm von Humboldt, Limits of State Action, 1791-2.

This is what I mean by privilege, alongside other aspects of its meaning in relation to education and social status. Also, the suggestion here is not that 'art' is emancipatory but that the freedom to enjoy ones own work and develop ones intellect in the doing of that work - something that is a privilege of artists, would be of benefit to everyone. Incidentally, where the work of artists converges with the work of other professions, vocations, compulsions, jobs, I do not think that it is worth much time discussing the artist's role in the process - as though the work that they do is exceptional to their counterparts in the rest of the world.
