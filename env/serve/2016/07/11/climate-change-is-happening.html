    <p>Actually began writing this about two years ago for a leaflet that I wanted to hand out near where I live in an effort to organise some meetings. It took me so long to write it and one night when I was working on it my house burnt down. I have not been able to concentrate on it since. That was over a year ago. It took me a very long time to write, even though it is very short. I wanted it to be factually correct and I consulted with some climate scientists about it. I think it it quite clear and concise and realised it was just sitting doing nothing on my computer.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-climate-change">What is Climate Change?</h4>
<p>Climate change refers to the long-term changes in weather conditions that are being caused by global warming. The main cause of recent warming is an increase in heat-absorbing gases in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>As the Sun warms Earth’s surface some of the heat radiates back out toward space and as it passes through the atmosphere it is absorbed by so-called greenhouse gases which then provide additional warmth back to the surface. This ‘greenhouse effect’ is a natural phenomenon that keeps Earth’s temperature in balance. Human activity is enhancing the greenhouse effect by releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, in particular carbon dioxide—CO₂.</p>

<p>CO₂ occurs naturally in the environment and, like other greenhouse gases, it is a waste product of the fossil fuels that have powered industrial progress for 250 years. When coal, oil, and natural gas are burned in power stations (or whatever else) CO₂ is released. The more fossil fuels we use the more CO₂ is stored in the atmosphere—causing it to retain more heat and thereby increasing Earth’s surface temperature. This is global warming—it is being caused by humans.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gases make up a small proportion of the atmosphere—they are measured in parts per million (ppm). During the past 800,000 years atmospheric levels of CO₂ have fluctuated between 170 and 300ppm. Since industrialisation began this has increased to around 400ppm and correspondingly Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by about 0.8ºC. This seemingly small increase has huge consequences.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-happening">What is Happening?</h4>
<p>The planet has warmed and as it continues to warm during this century the influence that this has on the climate and therefore all life on Earth will be catastrophic. We might limit the damage if we are able to respond—collectively and quickly.</p>

<p>In different regions of the planet climate change is causing vast loss of life and human migration, species extinction, heat waves, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, melting glaciers and loss of ice cover at the poles, permafrost thawing, loss of water resources, droughts, reduced crop yields, pest outbreaks, coastal and inland flooding, increased rainfall—and all the associated effects on local human populations.</p>

<p>These problems will worsen and some of them will act as part of a chain reaction that may cause irreversible change to the atmosphere and unthinkable loss of life—for humans and all other species. How we choose to continue living in the world will affect how catastrophic the change will be.</p>

<h4 id="institutional-change">Institutional Change</h4>
<p>In spite of the relative significance of climate change on the international political agenda, and considering the destructive power of climate change to “radically alter human existence” (to quote Tony Bliar), the response from the political establishment has been limited.</p>

<p>To reduce the impact of climate change we need to minimise its causes. For one, almost all remaining fossil fuels must be left in the ground. Such a concept is ‘radically’ at odds with the interests of state and corporate power. Though both continue to make claims about their understanding, responsibilities, and commitment to ‘tackling’ climate change, in reality global carbon dioxide emissions have increased steadily since concerns were first raised at the international level in 1988. Britain’s emissions were increasing until the financial crisis began in 2007 and are now on the rise again.</p>

<p>The institutions of government and big business have shown their inherent inability to act in a meaningful way to minimise the causes of climate change. Driven by the objectives of capitalism, they must work towards their own short-term interests: maintain power and maximise profits (anything else is public relations). The mass media, supposedly tasked with educating us about these problems, in fact conforms to the same corporate mentality—representing the interests of the wealthy elites who own and control them.</p>
