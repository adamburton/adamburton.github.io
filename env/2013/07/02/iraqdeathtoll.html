    <p>Two thirds of the British public estimate that since the beginning of the US / UK invasion of Iraq in March 2003, not more than 20,000 Iraqis (civilians and combatants) have been killed, according to a June 2013 Comres poll. It is likely, however, that between 600,000 and 1.2 million Iraqis have died as a consequence of the invasion*.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/red-water-1.jpg" alt="red water" /></p>

<p>This discrepancy in our perception of Britain’s violent actions abroad can perhaps be explained in some part by the role of the establishment mass media in colluding with elite interests. By collusion I mean that those who planned and conducted the invasion of Iraq are concerned to prevent the British public from knowing the effects of their policies and the mass media is owned, therefore controlled, by corporations who, naturally, support those policies which are too in their interests. That is not to say that cabinet ministers and newspaper owners, politicians and journalists, want millions of people to be killed in wars but, rather, that in the process of taking their position in society as leaders, editors, representatives, they seek to justify the rewards - control over resources - that such an invasion brings. They justify it in the same way that, for centuries, European elites have justified their actions (and hundreds of millions of deaths) as unadulterated benevolence.</p>

<p>Our leaders naturally believe that they should reap these rewards, should control resources, should be leaders, because society cannot function without them. Whilst much has changed in the world during the last 100 years there is little, beyond rhetoric, to suggest that where power concentrates, in corporate media institutions for example, it has decided to cease operating in its own interests.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The actual death toll from the invasion and “all of the evil” that followed**, should become more widely known - 2% of the British public estimate the more probable figure of 1 million deaths in Iraq. I have been thinking about trying to write an article about it and I thought yesterday that I should document the research process on-line. When I went to begin that today I felt as though I should explain myself in more than a handful of words on Twitter. I had for a moment considered what hashtag to use but this made me feel ill, partly because I feel like the words Iraq, death, and toll, when squeezed together and used repeatedly, over and over, at the end of already squeezed together pieces of information, makes light of what has happened and continues daily in Iraq.</p>

<p>This concern is going to arise throughout whatever I end up writing. Discussion of deaths in Iraq should be presented in the context of life in Iraq so that the need to use numbers (600,000 deaths, 1.2 million deaths, 2.5 million deaths) cannot over-simplify or de-humanise these events. I have not decided yet how to approach this but I was reminded of it the other day when reading Island of Shame by David Vine. He quotes two former US national security officials, Anthony Lake and Roger Morris, who resigned from the Nixon administration to protest the invasion of Cambodia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We remember, more clearly than we care to, the well carpeted stillness and isolation of those government offices where some of the Pentagon Papers were first written. The efficient staccato of the typewriter, the antiseptic whiteness of nicely margined memoranda, the affable, authoritative and always urbane men who wrote them—all of it is a spiritual as well as geographic world apart from piles of decomposing bodies in a ditch outside Hue or a village bombed in Laos, the burn ward of a children’s hospital in Saigon, or even a cemetery or veteran’s hospital here. It was possible in that isolated atmosphere, and perhaps psychologically necessary, to dull one’s awareness of the direct link between those memoranda and the human sufferings with which they were concerned.”
The Pentagon Papers (2); The Human Reality of Realpolitik - Foreign policy 4, 1971.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, when publicising the actual number of people killed in Iraq - the figures estimated in surveys, collated from media reports, 1000 deaths represented by a circle in an info-graphic, a note in the sidebar - those people, their lives, become a number, millions of bodies, other things, that never had life to begin with. How can we sharpen our awareness of their suffering as we try to comprehend the scale of it?</p>

<p>I am not really sure, at all, how to go about this. If I ask myself how I would feel about one million British people being killed in similar circumstances, I find myself unable to think anything, blinking, trying to shake the idea out of my head. Is it possible to empathise with so many grieving families? Is it possible to understand the impact that a war has on the individuals and the society when you have never experienced anything like it?
As I learn about the many causes of the many deaths in Iraq, hopefully, I can learn about Iraqi society and find a way to present the lives of those men, women and children as more than a big number.</p>

Noam Chomsky makes an important point in a <a href="https://chomsky.info/20130524/">recent interview</a> in response to a question about the death toll in Iraq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Now there are some principles which maybe we don’t like to think about but they are there and we created them, we established them. Those are the founding principles of modern international law which comes straight out of the Nuremberg Tribunal, and they can’t be repeated too often. The Nuremberg Tribunal which led to the hanging of German war criminals declared that “aggression is the Supreme International Crime differing from other war crimes in that it includes all of the evil that follows,”.”</p>
